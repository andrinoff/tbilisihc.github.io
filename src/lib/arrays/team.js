                                    For Drew Smirnoff, code is a native language he's been speaking since the age of six. What began as a childhood fascination with programming has evolved into a lifelong journey of technological mastery and a deep-seated passion for empowering others. This early start gave him a unique perspective: technology isn't just a career path, but a powerful tool for creativity and problem-solving that should be accessible to everyone.

                                    Witnessing the immense untapped potential in Georgian youth, Drew founded the Tbilisi Hack Club to bridge the gap between curiosity and creation. He wasn't just building a non-profit; he was building the kind of hands-on, collaborative community he wished he had as a young, aspiring programmer.

His leadership is defined by a "learn by doing" philosophy, championing an environment where experimentation is encouraged and failure is seen as a vital part of growth. He is more than just a CEO; he is a mentor and an architect of opportunity, dedicated to equipping Georgia's next generation with the skills to not only navigate the digital world but to build its future.
